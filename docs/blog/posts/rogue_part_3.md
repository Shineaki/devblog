## Part 8 - Items and Inventory

Another great chapter! We created some classes to support items & a basic inventory system. We implemented our first item: Health Potions, then we updated our procgen script to also generate these items in the rooms. Now we are able to pick up these potions and drink them to get some health back after fighting!

I also changed the colors a bit to make things more visible.

I really recommend this [tutorial](https://rogueliketutorials.com/) for everyone, because it is awesome and I feel like I learn a lot just by following (and basically copy-pasting code from the browser to the IDE) through.
