# Roguelike in PyGame - Init

So, I decided to learn about PyGame and use it for my next project.

<!-- more -->

## Plan

First of all, I would like to learn the basics of PyGame:

* Sprites
* Animations
* Tilemaps
* Events (user inputs)
* Sounds
* etc

Then I would like to re-create what I learned in the previous roguelike tutorial sessions, but with sprites, instead of the console "UI".

## Resources

## My progress so far

After spending ~30 minutes on reading various docs I jumped right in and started playing around with the framework.

I have to say, (after a quick glance-over of the docs) PyGame seems to be much more "raw" (barebone?) than I expected .. like I couldn't find an "AnimatedSprite" class, and stack overflow says I should implement it myself by iterating over the images .. aaand I kinda' like this! I might check out some things that are implemented in [Flame](https://docs.flame-engine.org/latest/) and take them over here to make PyGame more "user-friendly".

## Documenting things

I had to realize that documenting things here is a lot harder than I expected, because I cannot really decide if I should keep updating a single post (like in the PyRouge posts) or create new ones every single day. 

I guess I will have to find the perfect balance between the two, but for now my idea is to cluster the updates into weekly posts
