# PyRouge

Yes, I mispelled the name, but it is too late to change the repository name and everything, so it will remaine Py*Rouge*.

## :wrench: Build your own X

I found an amazing repository called [Build your own X](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x), which is a collection of posts, videos, tutorials, guides about implementing your own X ("X" being a game, a cli, a database or something like that).

This would help you understand how that "X" works and you would learn a lot about the programming language that is being used for the implementation. This finally gave me a burst of motivation to start coding something.

## :video_game: RougelikeTutorials

Obviously I jumped straight to the "Game" section, where I found a great site: [RoguelikeTutorials.com](https://rogueliketutorials.com) and started coding the tutorial right away.

The tutorial uses Python and [tcod](https://github.com/libtcod/python-tcod) (a C library ported to Python that contains useful things for roguelike game development, like a customizable console, grid-based pathfinding, etc) to implement the basics of the original Rogue.

## :confused: Why

Long story short, in my lifetime I want to implement a game.
Probably not now and not even next year ... but sometime when I will have enough dedication and experience.
A game that I enjoy playing.
And I only play (and enjoy) online / multiplayer games, but implementing those are *god-damn hard*.

Creating a good single-player game is hard enough for a solo (or small team) indie developer(s) ... you have to think about UI / UX, a good gameplay loop, a hook, a progression system, balance, a story, a coherent visual design, ... and the list goes on.
Adding server-authoritive networking to the picture makes the whole thing 10x harder.
