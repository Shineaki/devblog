# PyRouge

Yes, I mispelled the name, but it is too late to change the repository name and everything, so it will remaine *Rouge*.

## Build your own X 

I found an amazing repository called [Build your own X](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x), which is a collection of posts, videos, tutorials, guides about implementing your own X ("X" being a game, a cli, a database or something like that).

This would help you understand how that "X" works and you would learn a lot about the programming language that is being used for the implementation. This finally gave me a burst of motivation to start coding something.

## RougelikeTutorials

Obviously I jumped straight to the "Game" section, where I found a great site: [RoguelikeTutorials.com](https://rogueliketutorials.com) and started coding the tutorial right away.

The tutorial uses Python and [tcod](https://github.com/libtcod/python-tcod) (a C library ported to Python that is used for roguelike development)
