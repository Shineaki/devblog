# PyRouge #2

I continue my journey with the implementation of Py*Rouge*.

<!-- more -->

## Part 4 - Field of view

Implemented! I think it looks great and it improves a lot on the feel of the whole thing :smiley:
Also, now I know that I can embed videos too, I had no idea mkdocs can do that. And I installed a spell checker to help with the typos.

<figure class="video_container">
    <video controls src="../../../../images/rouge_fov.mp4" title="Title"></video>
</figure>

## Part 5 - Placing Enemies and kicking them

Coming soon
