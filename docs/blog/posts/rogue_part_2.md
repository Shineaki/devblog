# PyRouge #2

I continue my journey with the implementation of Py*Rouge*.

<!-- more -->

## Part 4 - Field of view

Implemented! I think it looks great and it improves a lot on the feel of the whole thing :smiley:
Also, now I know that I can embed videos too, I had no idea mkdocs can do that. And I installed a spell checker to help with the typos.

    <video controls src="../../../../images/rouge_fov.mp4" title="Title"></video>
</figure>

## Part 5 - Placing Enemies and kicking them

Enemies are now generated - 80% for an Orc (O) and 20% for a Troll (T). They do not move yet and they do not attack / take damage yet.
I will try to add various monsters with different stats, based on the level we are on (like in the real Rogue).

## Part 6 - Doing (and taking) some damage

Part 6 starts of with a huge refactoring session. I took over those changes, the rest is coming tomorrow.
