# Init Blog

Over the last `2 WEEKS` I spent `120 HOURS` playing a game that I hate, so it's time to do something else ...

<!-- more -->

## Intro

I decided to create a blog to document if I do something "useful" in my freetime.

## Background

Last week I had to realize that over 2 weeks I spent almost 120 hours playing Dota, a game that I don't even enjoy playing. During these 2 weeks I also worked and slept 8-8 hours a day, so if we do the math, I literally haven't done anything useful ... and I am not sure if the weeks before that were any different, so it is time for a change.

## Topics

There are a few topics that I enjoy spending time on, e.g.: 

* Frontend (e.g React) and backend (flask, fastapi, etc) topics
* App (mobile) developent (with Flutter)
* Game development (Flutter-Flame, Godot, Unity ... or something from scratch?!)

Currently I don't have any concrete ideas (apart from a simple productivity / time tracker app, but I will describe that later), I just want to start working on some home projects again.
